# Diplomka
Author: OndÅ™ej Burda

This is my Master's degree project.

Mostly runs on Vaadin and Spring Boot.

## Running and debugging the application

### Running the application from the command line.
To run from the command line, use `mvn` and open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

### Running and debugging the application in Intellij IDEA
- Locate the Application.java class in the Project view. It is in the src folder, under the main package's root.
- Right-click on the Application class
- Select "Debug 'Application.main()'" from the list

After the application has started, you can view it at http://localhost:8080/ in your browser. 
You can now also attach breakpoints in code for debugging purposes, by clicking next to a line number in any source file.

### Running and debugging the application in Eclipse
- Locate the Application.java class in the Package Explorer. It is in `src/main/java`, under the main package.
- Right-click on the file and select `Debug As` --> `Java Application`.

Do not worry if the debugger breaks at a `SilentExitException`. This is a Spring Boot feature and happens on every startup.

After the application has started, you can view it at http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
You can now also attach breakpoints in code for debugging purposes, by clicking next to a line number in any source file.
